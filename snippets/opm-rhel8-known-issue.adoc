There is currently a known issue where the version of the `opm` CLI tool released with {product-title} {product-version} does not support RHEL 8. As a workaround, RHEL 8 users can navigate to the link:https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/clients/ocp/latest-4.14/[OpenShift mirror site] and download the latest version of the tarball released with {product-title} 4.14.
