There is a known issue in {olmv1}. If you assign insufficient RBAC to an extension's service account, {olmv1} gets stuck in an reconciliation loop.

Currently, {olmv1} does not have tooling to help determine the appropriate RBAC for a service account.

Since {olmv1} is a Technology Preview feature and must not be used on production clusters, you can avoid this issue by using the more permissive set of RBAC included in the documentation.

This set of RBAC is intended for testing purposes only. Do not use it on production clusters.
